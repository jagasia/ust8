What is Git?
	is a verson control tool

		jira
		jenkins
		

Storage
version control
cloud based repository
collobaration
tracking changes

----------------------------
Github
GitLab
BitBucket
	platforms/portals to work with git and create remote repositories
	
What is a repository?
	local repository
	remote repository

we can consider one of our "folders" in our system, as a local repository.

git allows us to synchronize this local repository with a remote repository.

sync	
	upload
	download

Any cloud platform can provide
	Storage services
	Compute services
	Network services

Git comes under the storage services.
Git allows us to store our 
	code
	files
	folders
	libraries
		in remote repository
so that your team members can pull them and do changes and push them.

pull
push

we can maintain multiple branches, hence multiple versions.

What is version management?
	version?????

When team members contribute to the same project,
i have done some code.	(my version)
you have done some code.	(your version)


if, a developer, do some change in the existing project,
after deployment.

it needs re-deployment.

reactjs project to AWS.
AWS credentials is available with only 1 person.
so every time, you do changes to the project,
you cannot ask that deployer (aws) to re deploy.

What we did?
	we created a CI/CD pipleline (aws code pipeline)
	git is able to notify when there is a change.
	everytime, i push changes to git, it creates a re deployment automatically.	

Look at the convenient for the developer,
everytime, i make changes to my code, 
i just need to push to git.

how do you check the git version in your system?

Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.4046]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\Users\rjaga>git --version
git version 2.35.1.windows.2

C:\Users\rjaga>git version
git version 2.35.1.windows.2

C:\Users\rjaga>
-------------------------------
we will use "git hub" for remote repositories.

Lets create a git repository:
	local
	remote

local:	d:\jag\git_batch8
remote:	https://github.com/jagasia/git_batch8

login to github and create the remote repository

we have created 
	git_batch8
https://github.com/jagasia/git_batch8.git

i will upload one text file
	how?

add the file to local repository.
i will push the changes to remote.

new repository (first time)
echo "# git_batch8" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/git_batch8.git
git push -u origin main

-----------------
go to git bash in your local repository location
	right click your local repository
		git bash here
	confirm your location
		pwd
present working directory

our local repository has
	readme.txt

how to push this to remote repository?
first time:
	git init
		this command creates a 
			.git folder
		this will create a stage for our git operation
		
whatever i add
	i commit
	branch
	merge
all these are done on the staging directory	.git only
only when i push these changes from staging moves to remote repo.

git init

how local repository is linked to remote repository
	git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/git_batch8.git

to add files
	git add .
---------------------
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/git_batch8.git
git branch -M jag
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git push -u origin jag

----------------------------------
Task:
	choose one of your folders as local repository.
	ensure that it is not part of any other repository.
	create a remote repository in github
	in your local repository, create one or more files and then
	push this to remote.

	Share your remote url in the chat window

-------------------------
first time,
we used
git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/git_batch8.git
git branch -M jag

but subsequent times, we do not need to mention the above 2 lines,
especially when the branch is same.

git status
	show the status of the repo

Task:
	each of you already have pushed atleast 1 file.
	now, create a different branch
	and push changes to atleast 1 file

	now, checkout as branch1
	see the file
	now, checkout as branch2
	see the file

in windows,
in github
------------------
git branch
	to see all the available branches
	and the current branch is highlighted

Question:
i do a commit at 09:00
i do a push at 10:00

in my remote repository, which time it will show?
ans:	the commit time will be reflecting, even though we pushed one hour late.

Whoever has created 2 branches.
	i) checkout as one branch, and check the file
	ii) checkout as another branch, and check the file

change detection:
	red color - implies, it is deleted line(s)
	green color - implies, it is added line(s)

--------------------------------
Collobaration
let us invite 1 or more collaborator for this repository.

you have used one email address while creating github account.
	kindly share that email address in chat window

i will sent invite to collaborate.

How to add a collaborator to the git repository?
	settings	-> Collaborators
		

in bitbucket, it is 
	repository permissions
in github, it is
	collaborators

----------------------------------------------
now, the collaborators, can push contents to my repository.
remember,
	you create a local repository first.
identify a folder in your system (which is not part of any other git repository).

either
i) you can clone my repository		git clone https://....
	go inside the folder and push changes
or
ii) you can pull my repository into your local repository
---------------------------------
Now, in our remote repository, some collaborators have done some contributions.

How, will i get those changes in my local repository (windows folder)?


-------------------------------------
Learning git
	creating local repository
	creating remote repository
	creating branches
	push
	merge
	pull
	checkout
	delete the branches after merge.

GitLab
	allows us to create projects
	create milestones
	create backlogs/issues (tasks)
	assign tasks to members
	and update the status

	code repository (git)
	
team members push their branches

rest api
	entity		(employee, department)
	repo
	service
	controller

Employee
	id
	name
	department		

i am dependent on other member who create Department

i will merge his department with my branch

now, i will get
Employee
Department

Jira
	project
	team members
	link to gitlab/github/bitbucket

--------------------------------
CI/CD
	Jenkins
	aws code pipeline

Demo:
	to witness, how git is going to redeploy our changes in our project in cloud using CI/CD

1) create a reactjs project in
	d:\jag\cicd\
	npx create-react-app kavin

2) cd kavin
	npm start
-----------
3) in aws, elastic beanstalk
	we create an application "kavin"
		kavin.ap-south-1.elasticbeanstalk.com
	this is showing sample application by aws.
-------------
4) we will create a ci/cd pipleline
	in aws, it is code pipeline

before that, we need a git url....
	https://github.com/jagasia/kavin.git

we push the contents of kavin folder to this remote repository

Steps for creating the pipeline
stage 1:	source		git
stage 2: 	build		skip
stage 3:	deploy		elastic beanstalk

we have created a pipeline, that pulls the project from github and deploy it in aws elastic beanstalk.

-------------------------------
When i do some changes in my code, 
i will push the changes to git.
immediately, it should create a trigger and redeploy it in aws.

-----------------------
Jenkins
	to run a program from git.
	why? why do you want your code in git, to execute.
	advantage is,
		whenever you change the code and push to git,
	it should reflect in next execution.
otherwise,
	your code is pulled by somebody and they run the code.
	if you modify the code, then you need to notify them.
	instead, "git" is in the middle.

	you push code to git.
	they run code pulled from git.

	Instead of you doing the pull and run,
	jenkins can do that.


a simple java hello world program, i will run using jenkins.
the code is pulled by jenkins from git.

1) created a git hub repository
	abylin
2) create a folder "abylin"
	D:\Jag\cicd\abylin
3) in local repository, create a hello world program:
	App.java
public class App
{
	public static void main(String []args)
	{
		System.out.println("Hello Jag");
	}
}

4) push this to git
	git init
	git add .
	git commit -m "first
	git branch -M jag
	git remote add origin https://github.com/jagasia/abylin.git
	git push -u origin jag

running jenkins is very simple:
download jenkins.war

set path=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1\bin
java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9090

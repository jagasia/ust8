------------------------------------
SDLC models
------------------
Waterfall model
V model
Spiral model
Iterative model
Agile model
Incremental model
RAD model
Prototyping model
Sliced model

Waterfall model
----------------------
	is sequential

	only when you have good expertise in this type of project.
	not flexible	/ rigid
	high risk
	no prototyping
----------------------
Prototyping
	means, we provide the user a sample.
	i) customer may understand the product during trial version
	ii) customer finds it useful to buy the original version
	iii) customer understands that he needs

trial/ prototype sample	will not have all functionalities.

	customer is not able to express all his requirements.

Risk factor
	


RAD
	parallely work on multiple components creating.


Agile model
----------------
Agile means, quick, swift, fast
if you want to analyse, design the entire project, it will take time

in agile, 
	the portions, whichever is analysed, designed are started to move to implementation immediately.
	
	it will split the entire project into several smaller units and each units are processed as sprints

Sprint
	usually	1 or 2 weeks period

Scrum master	
backlogs are issued to the team member
morning stand up meet
	to list out the backlogs 		Product Backlog
	teams share their learnings and solutions every day.



Doubt/ Difficulty

To choose the right model
1) Project size
2) Project type	(familer/ new)
3) Risk factor
4) Customer understanding of their own requirements		(protyping)



Validation:		Requirements are validated		(choosing the product)
Verification:	Product is verified			(testing the product)

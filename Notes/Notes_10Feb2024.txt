Last week we discussed,
	Number systems
SDLC
--------
	Softward Development Life Cycle

is a scientific / systematic approach of developing software.

List out the phases of SDLC

Stage 1: Project Planning. ...
Stage 2: Gathering Requirements & Analysis. ...
Stage 3: Design. ...
Stage 4: Coding or Implementation. ...
Stage 5: Testing. ...
Stage 6: Deployment. ...
Stage 7: Maintenance.
	
RUP
	Rational Unified Process
The RUP initiation, elaboration, construction, and transition phases can all be iterated		
------------------------------------
Inception/ Conception
-----------------------------
	The customer identifies his need / problem that needs a solution.
	System analyst understands/ identifies the problem and that the customer needs a solution.

	we are the solutions provider, we already have provided a solution, but still we keep doing research to find better techniques to provide a better solution, periodically.

	If microsoft, waited to produce Windows 10, it would have been failure.

	1990s, they released windows 3
	what microsoft do?	they keep releasing next versions.


Understand the need for a solution.	(Phase 1)

Requirements gathering:
---------------------------------
suppose you are going to develop a software for a domain (Banking domain)

You are very good java/ java fullstack technologies. It doesn't mean you can do a better solution/ s/w for Bank


what is a domain?
	
in which domain, 

the customer is called as Patient?
	Medical/Hospital
the customer is called as 
	Passenger	- Transportation	
	Tenent	- Real estate
	Student	- Student



Banking is a domain
Credit card industry is a vertical

Product/ Project
Product is developed first and sold to customers
Project means, we found a customer and develop the software



Requirement gathering:
	appoint a domain expert
	observation
	Branstorming
	storyboarding
	empathy maps
	journey maps

	
All these are based on the 
	processes involved in the business

Bank has the following processes:
	Transactions		withdraw/ deposit/ funds transfer
	Loan
		apply loan
		approve/reject loan
		pay emi
		make part payment
		pre-closure
		
	account creation
	address change update		they are able to trace all your address change request.


	a customer can have many accounts

	CUSTOMER	-	ACCOUNT		is 1 to M

User story: contains use cases.
each process may become a use case.

account creation
withdraw
deposit
apply loan

You will record the document as paragraph.


OOAD

ANALYSIS:
-------------------
Analaysis
	system analyst will use his team to do a analysis.
	Feasibility Study
		is it possible to implement the requirement
		with the given 
			cost	(customer side)
			features	15 
			time	30
			resource	20
		
		Risk management 
	
	important reason for going to spiral approach

	Product Owner
	Project Owner

SRS document	-	Software/System Requirements Specification


every phase in SDLC, has a deliverable to the next phase.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Design phase:
---------------------
	blueprint of the project
	interface design
	system architecture
	flow diagram

you can easily understand, if you notice how construction companies work.

19 floors of building construction
	if customer will come to know only after the construction,
	then if suppose, customer do not like, what happens?	it is not possible to rework later.

same, applies to software also.
It takes lot of hard work to complete the project.
A change in later stage again is going to be difficult.


we need diagrams ( as many diagrams) that depict the actual project, how it is going to come in future
this is very important to 
	Get the acceptance criteria.

the diagrams that represent the project
	UML

UML	-	Unified Modeling Language

Use Case Diagram
Class Diagram
Object Diagram
Package Diagram
Component Diagram
Deployment Diagram
Sequence Diagram
State Machine Diagram
Activity Diagram
Interaction Overview Diagram

for drawing use case diagrams?
	MS Visio
	Jude
	Rational Rose	

	online websites that allow us to draw these diagrams.


What is an use case diagram?
	is an implementation of user view.

no technical implementations
just user's view of understanding.

If you ellaborate an use case, the you will get 
	Activity diagram	( is like a flow chart )

use case: Withdraw
	if you ellaborate?
	
1) insert atm card
2) enter pin number
3) validate pin number
4) if pass
	then ask amount
	validate amount
		amount is lesser than his account balance
		amount is lesser than daily limit
		amount is lesser than the amount available in the machine
		yes pass
			remember to collect the cash.

5) if fail?
	reject the transaction.


Class Diagram
----------------------
it is already decided, what are the classes to be coded
what are the properties and methods of a class
all are clearly mentioned in the class diagram


Class
	1) name of the class
	2) properties
	3) methods

-	private
+	public
#	protected
~	internal


Sequence diagram:
-------------------------
	timing, when an object is created and destroyed (life line)
	when a method of an object calls the method of another / same object


If all these 10 diagrams are provided to you,
	then you will be able to do the coding
	without even discussing/ clarifying anything

----------------------------------
Implementation/ Development/ Coding
-----------------------------------------------------
the best code/ the quality of the code is determined only based on 
how exactly you implemented the given DESIGN.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
Testing
	what is testing? when it begins?


debugging of our code		finding the logical error in the code.	(programmer)
unit testing			programmer	(but test cases, provided by testing team)
Verifying the correctness and functionality of code		perfect		
begins at end of development
integration testing
system testing

we got the above random answers.

The testers role begins even before the programmers start coding.

Testers create 
	test cases for each use cases

for every use case,
	they may write around 20 test cases

these test cases, (some are kept as hidden) and some sample test cases are provided to the programmers

Requirements testing:
	whether the requirements are recorded clearly, unambigously and the testability of the requirement.
	it is the acceptance criteria


For every phase in SDLC, there will be a testing phase

Unit testing
	when you learn java, you also should learn, JUnit
	every method in java, you write, should be tested with the test cases.

Functional testing 	(unit testing is a type of functional / black box testing)

Sonar Qube
	code quality
	declared variables are initialised.		unused variables are removed
	comments		comments that explain the code are allowed.		java code is commented (is poor). remove them
	System.out.println		should be replaced by logs.
	while coding itself, we want to ensure that quality.



TDD	-	Test Driven Development
	The programmers are provided with test cases.
	they should 
		write code to fail	
		modify code to pass
		refactor the code		(modify the structure of the code without changing the logic)
integration testing
	units may pass the test
	but when they interact with eachother they may fail
	

regression testing?
	when the programmer, fix the bugs, 
	after fixing the bugs, the tester will test again.
	this is regression testing.

Deployment:
-----------------
	installation
	put data on the server
	final product

is a transition phase
	the sofware is moved from 
		development computer to production computer


Deployment, now a days, are taken care by software service provider
deployment team, needs to configure the application
according to the clients configuration

CONFIGURATION
	XML configurations

should be text based that do not need recompilation when we modify the file

Maintenance:
------------------
why it is very important today, because, today, we are more into selling service than product.

what is the difference between Product and Service?

Airtel
OnePlus


zoho does not sell me a product, they sell service

books.zoho.com
	is up to date with government norms on
		GST
		TDS
		etc

that means 
	service is up to date
i am not buying product
i am buying service

any change needs to be implemented.

Microsoft Windows
	there will be time to time bugs are identified
	and the fixes are sent to us a 
		Windows update
	patches
	updates

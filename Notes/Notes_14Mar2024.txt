Git

CI/CD

Can one of you unmute and share the topics/ sub topics you learned / came across 
while learning module 2

lets list out the details and share the concepts that may be useful for your assessments.

Dockers

Deployment
	moving our project from development machine to client's production machine.
	challenges we face during deployment

Virtualization
	Virtual PC
	Remote Desktop
	VMWare

	drawback:
		heavy weight.
		in your operating system (windows), we can run a virtual machine called Linux.
		
Containerization
	instead of having a virtual pc,
	Why not only package the necessary components to run a project alone.
	
	a container, will contain, all that is necessary to run a project
		OS features
		runtime env
		system files
		memory to reserve

	everything.
	containerization is a light weight version of virtualization

Docker
	imagine, if you create a docker image of your project,
	then you can run this image in any computer, where docker is only installed. No need to install anything

	while running a Docker image, 
	a Docker container is created

	this container, is like a virtual machine. that contains everything that needed to run a project.



in AWS,
	ECR	-	Elastic Container Registry		similar to docker hub, by AWS
	ECS	-	Elastic Container Service		runs docker images as containers


if you run docker image, you will get docker container.
